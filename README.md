# OpenAgents

OpenAgents is a platform for building and commercializing AI agents using shared databases of skills and knowledge. It
will soon include a two-sided marketplace for builders and users of AI agents.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/OpenAgentsInc/openagents/wiki) for more.

## How it works

- A user creates an Agent from Nodes.
- Nodes are defined by community developers. They could be:
    - API endpoints
    - External WASM plugins
    - Conditional logic
    - Data parsing
    - Or most anything compatible with flow-based programming
- Nodes may have an associated fee which is paid to the node creator when the node is used in a workflow
- Agents can be used in our UI and via API
- Users can comment/rate/share Nodes
- Leaderboards show what's popular
